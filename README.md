<p align="center">Abstract </p>
<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common mental illness that can seriously 
affect a child's daily life, academic performance, and overall health. Early diagnosis 
and appropriate interventions are critical to improving long-term outcomes for 
affected children. In recent years, smartphones and mobile apps have gained 
prominence as potential tools to complement traditional treatments for a variety of 
psychiatric disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder. The proposal focuses 
on advancing the treatment of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
using mobile technology. So, in our project, we try to use mobile apps to address this 
issue, helping children overcome OCD through cognitive-behavioral techniques, 
exposure therapy and mindfulness exercises. Fun elements and interactive features 
have been incorporated to encourage adherence to treatment regimens. Real-time 
progress tracking and data analysis enable therapists and caregivers to adjust 
treatment plans as needed to maximize their impact. Parental involvement is critical 
to successful treatment of OCD in children. The app facilitates regular 
communication between parents, children, and therapists, allowing insights, updates, 
and concerns to be shared. By involving parents in the treatment process, the proposal 
aims to create a supportive environment that reinforces positive behaviors and speeds 
recovery.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
